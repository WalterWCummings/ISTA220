1.  What is the difference betweendeep copyandshallow copy? if one field is a reference type it needs a clone method otherwise the clone method will copy a reference ; when the clone method copies references its a shallow copy 

Sallow copy is a copy of the reference (just on the stack) ; Deep copy - copies from both sources of memory 

2.  What is the value of a reference after you declare and initialize it?   Its the memory location of the actual data.

3.  How do you declare a value type? Give it a type, name, and (optional) assign the value.

4.  How do you declare a reference type? Use the ref keyword 

5.  Does C# allow you to assign NULL to a value type? Yes - using the "int? Walt" or "var? name"

6.  Can you assign a nullable value type to a non-nullable variable of the same type?  Why or why not? No. A non-nullable value rquires a specified range of results. NULL is the absence of any value. 

7.  What is the difference between the stack and the heap? Stack is memory piled ontop of one anohter. Heaps are piles of memory; reference types are created here. (Heaps is in the operating system - unorganized) (Stacks are organized "packaged data")

8.  What does it mean when we say that all classes are specialized types? all classes are ST of the system.object and you can create a variable that can refer to any ref type


9.  What does ref do? keyword that signals the C# complier to generate a code that passes a reference to the argument (not a copy) Direct link to the original. 

10.  What does out do? allows the method to initialize the parameter. 

11.  Describe boxing and unboxing in your own words. Boxing: automatic copying of an item from a stack to a heap. Unboxing: compiler extracting the values from the box and copies into a var

12.  What does cast do? Specifies the data referenced in an object has a type.
