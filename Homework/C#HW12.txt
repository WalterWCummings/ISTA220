Inhertiance allows you to use a main class to govern multiple subclasses if they are closely related to one another. 
Derived class to mirror functions of base classes. ; save one repeating code and store it in a function/procedure




2.  What is the syntax of a derived class that inherits from a base class?
derivedclass: baseclass



3.  Do all user defined types (classes and structs) inherit from some base class?  If so, what is it?
Yes; System.Object class
Struct cannot inherit from 




4.  What happens if you do not have a default constructor in a base class when creating a derived class?
Compiletime-error; A default constructor will be made



5.  Can you assign a variable of a derived class to another variable of its base class?  Why or why not?
Yes; The variables of the base class are 



6.  Can you assign a variable of a derived class to another variable of of a derived class of its base class?Why or why not?
no
No


7.  Can you assign a variable of a base class to another variable of a derived class?  Why or why not?
yes, you'd need to note that the new varible will have the elements of the derived class, not the base.



8.  Under  what  circumstances  would  you  want  to  use  thenewkeyword  when  defining  a  method  in  aderived class?
Replacing existing data in the base class


9.  What is avirtualmethod?  Why would you want to define a virtual method?
When you want a method within a method of the same class.



10.  What doesoverridedo?  Why does it do it?
The same signature method can be called but will have it's own function and class; if you wanted to 



11.  How do you define anextension type?




12.  Why do you define anextension type?
Extend the initial class with additional static methods
