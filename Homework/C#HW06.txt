1.  What is anexception? a catch method that allows for the code to run despite a specified error; an error or 

2.  What happens in atryblock if the program executes without errors? Runs without error and continues as normal

3.  How does thecatchmechanism work for unhandled exceptions? the program will exit the method and returns to the calling method; program throws the exception to the enclosing block.  ; handled: exception with a catch block somewhere; unchecked: no catch block; 

4.  What happens in a program if anexception blockfails to handle an particular error? it will result to a catch handle if present, if not the program will terminate. 

5.  What is the parent class for all exceptions?  How does this work? Exception Class; Stores all the various types of exceptions for c#

6.  How do you determine the type of an error? the error prompt will identify the type of error. ; Message property

7.  What is the purpose of integer checking? to controloverflow exception useing the checked and unchecked method

8.  What  is  the  range  of  values  than  a  signed  Int32  type  can  contain?   State  the  lowest  value  and  thehighest value. 2,147,483,648 through -2,147,483,648; MaxValue and MinValue

9.  What is the range of values than an unsigned Int32 type can contain?  State the lowest value and thehighest value.  What is the difference between a signed integer and an unsigned integer?  Can signedintegers and unsigned integers represent the same amount of numbers? MaxValue and MinValue; unisgnedVaules can go higher than signed values.

10.  What does the finally block do? the catch-all, ensure your code runs without fail. 

11.  (Thought question) When would you not use a finally block in a try/catch construction? When you know it's going to work properly. If you want to test the errors.
