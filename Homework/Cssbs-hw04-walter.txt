1. **What are all possible values of Boolean expression?**

	- true or false

2. **List the equality operators. List the relational operators. List the logical operators. How are they the same? How are they different?**

	- ==, !=
	- <, <=, >, >=
	- &&, ||
	- All are used to compare value within an expression
	- They differ in how they compare the values and what they check for
	
3. **What is the general concept of short circuiting? This question has a short and simple answer and you do not need to have a detailed response.** ; as soon as the expression can't be true for the logical operator, it shorts curcuit. 

	- As soon as the expression is false, the rest can't be true;

4. **What are the difference in how short circuiting works for && and ||?**

	- && short-circuits at the first false
	- || short-circuits after all values are evaluated
	
5. **Look at the list of operators. What operator has the highest precedence? Which has the lowest?**

	- () is the highest
	- = is the lowest

6. **In an if or else construction using multiple lines of code, what effect does the use of curly braces have?**
Provides the scope for the if or else statement. without the curly braces, the statement will only evaulate the first line. "No ; after the curly braces because it's not a statemnt  
	- 
	
7. **In a switch statement, what happens if you omit break?** It evualautes the statements in the next case. 


8. **The four keywords in a switch statement are switch, case, break, and default. Explain what each keyword does.** Switch is the keyword that initiates the switch statement; keyword that indicates where the expressions are located; break is the keywoard used to escape the scope of the switch statement; Automatic statemtent to execute if all cases are false.  


9. **Look at the source listing below. It contains two methods: recurr1() and recurr2(). There is a significant difference between the two methods. What is it?** Recur1 has one parameter; Recur2 has two parameters. 


10. **(Not in book) What is a recursive method? Using a language you know (such as English), write a recursive method that adds up the integers in a list of integers. The input to the method is a list of integers and the output is a scalar value representing a sum.** a method which can call on itself until it is satsified. 


11. **(Not in book) Read a short summary of De Morgan’s laws.**

	1. *Explain how this statement, ”It’s not snowing or raining,” is the same as this statement, ”It’s not snowing and it’s not raining.”* weather != (snowing | raining) = (weather != snowing && weather != raining)
		- 
		
	1. *Explain how this statement, ”I’m not running and walking,” is the same as this statement, ”I’m not running or I’m not walking.”* (state != running && walking) = (state != running or state != walking) 		-
