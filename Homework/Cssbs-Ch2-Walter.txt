**1. What is a local variable?**
- A variable within a small seciton of code, such as a method 

**2. What is a statement?**
- A command that result in an action performed; programming construct that issues a command. (informal: "anything that ends with a semicolon")

(What is an expression? two oprands and 1 operator; Programming construct that evualates to a value.)

**3. What is an identifier?**
- Names used to identify elements within the program; Synonym: "name" 

**4. What is a keyword?**
- Identifiers within the language that can't be resused

**5. What is a variable?**
- A storage location for a value(or temp info); "a variable is a named location in memory that may contain a value" 

**6. How do you declare a variable? How do you assign a value to a variable? Can you have a variable that does not have a value? Can you declare and initialize a variable in a single statement?**

- A variable is declared with the type and name(identifier)
- The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to the variable; takes from the right hand side and places to the left hand side.
- A variable must be explicitly assigned to use it, but it can be created without assignment
- You can declare and initialize a variable in the same statement.

**7. What does Visual Studio do when you open a project (a .csproj file) without opening the solution (a .sln file)? Why might this be a problem?**
- A new solution file (.sln) is created. This can create multiple solution files for the same project.

**8. How are arithmetic operators and variable types related?**
- Arithmetic operators can be used with variables to change the value of the variable

**9. How do you turn an integer into a string?**
- Use of the ```toString()``` method

**10. How do you turn a string into an integer?**
- ```int32.parse()``` method 

**11. What is the difference between precedence and associativity? Give an example where this makes a difference.**
-precedence can result in different order of execution that has a different outcome; vertical order 
-Associativity is the direction order used to evaluate expressions; horizontal order
- (3-1)*5

**12. What is the definite assignment rule?**
- Before a variable can be used, it has to be initialized

**13. How are the prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators evaluated differently?**
- Prefix operators are evaluated immediately
- Postfix operators are evaluated afterwards.

**14. What is string interpolation?**
-Syntax used to include variables in strings instead of concating them together; using string interpolation you can direct the 

**15. What does the var keyword do?**
- it is a variable that interprets the value type; allows the compiler to identify the value 



Notes: 

1. Local Variable

block 1
 {	
    car1 //visible throughout 
    block 2
    {
	var2 //ciaible in block 2
	     //var 1 is also visible here
    block3
    {
      var3 //visible i block 3, also var1 and var3
    }
    //var 3 out of scope
    var2
    var1
  }
  var1 //only
}
